      Weavr is a frontend framework for Opportunity International's web platforms.
      It is mobile first, lightweight, fully responsive, and 100% on-brand. It's
      designed to avoid the clutter of CSS classes that some other frameworks
      require, instead relying as much as possible on (highly opinionated) default
      styles for semantic markup, leaving the use of CSS classes for layouts,
      modules, and for tweaking elements with modifiers and utility classes.
