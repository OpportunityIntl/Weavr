## Some background on Weavr

The Weavr framework was created for Opportunity International to speed up development time for new pages/projects and to ensure consistency across Opportunity's web platforms.

It is lightweight (compared to frameworks like Foundation and Bootstrap), fully responsive and mobile first. One of our goals was to build a CSS framework that avoids the clutter of classnames that some other frameworks require in your markup, instead relying as much as possible on highly opinionated default styles for semantic markup, leaving the use of CSS classes for layouts, modules, and for modifying elements with modifier and utility classes.

Weavr's default styles are highly opinionated to promote consistency in design patterns across Opportunity's web platforms. In contrast to other frameworks, which are designed to be customized and adapted to anyone's brand or website design, Weavr is meant to be 100% on-brand for Opportunity and no one else.

## Take a look
