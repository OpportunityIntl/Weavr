Weavr is less opinionated when it comes to layouts, as they can vary widely from project to project and can often be fairly complex (especially with responsive sites). For layouts, Weavr provides:

- basic layout tools like containers, grids, and viewport-height sections
- utility classes for display, padding, margins, floats, etc.
- body copy layouts, which constrain content to a defined width within a container and allow elements to extend to the container edges for visual effect
