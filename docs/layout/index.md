Weavr is less opinionated when it comes to layouts, as they can vary widely from project to project and can often be fairly complex (especially with responsive sites). Weavr provides basic layout tools like containers, grids, and viewport-height sections, as well as utility classes for display, padding, margins, floats, etc.
