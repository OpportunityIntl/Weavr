    </p>
    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>Opportunity International was founded in 1971 by two visionary leaders who were inspired to take action by their experiences with people living in extreme poverty.</p>
    <p>Al Whittaker, former president of Bristol Myers International Corporation in the U.S., and Australian entrepreneur David Bussau sought a solution that would help people transform their lives and sustain their success.</p>
    <p>Opportunity International was one of the first nonprofit organizations to recognize the benefits of microfinance &ndash; <a href="">financial services for low-income people</a> &ndash; in developing countries.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is a great privilege to partner with Opportunity International in our effort to alleviate hunger in Malawi and Mozambique. Opportunity's technology driven microfinance services help create a sustainable framework to increase food production and bring access to financing for thousands of hunger-afflicted people.
