##Typography
`.brand-font-primary`
Set font to Proxima Nova Regular. Probably unecessary, as the `body` should already have Proxima Nova set as the font-family.

`.brand-font-secondary`
Set font to Times New Roman, italic.

`.align-left`, `.align-center`, `.align-right`
Align content. Setting left-align unnecessary in most situations, as text is left-aligned by default.

`p.large`
Use larger paragraph font-size.

`p.small`
Use smaller paragraph font-size.
